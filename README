iopart-num -- BibTeX style for IOP journals

--------------------------------

The iopart-num BibTeX style is intended for use with Institute of
Physics Publishing journals, including Journal of Physics.  A numeric
citation style is provided, based upon the specification in "How to
prepare and submit an article for publication in an IOP Publishing
journal using LaTeX2e" (February 2014).

The distribution contains the BibTeX style files (iopart-num.bst and
iopart-num-long.bst), the source files for the documentation
(iopart-num.tex and iopart-num.bib), and a PDF file of the
documentation (iopart-num.pdf).
